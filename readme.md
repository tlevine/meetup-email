Change Meetup email settings
====
This disables the emails that Tom finds annoying for all of your meetups.
If you want emails for some meetups, you could run this and then change those
later. Or you can extend this to handle the exceptions. Run it like so.

    export MEETUP_EMAIL_ADDRESS=abc@def.ghi
    export MEETUP_PASSWORD=aBcd3fGhi
    ./meetup_settings.py
